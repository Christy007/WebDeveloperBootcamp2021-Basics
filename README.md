# HTML Boilerplate
- It is the structure of the html file.
- It starts with a flag **< !DOCTYPE html >** which specifies the html version and type of document that we are building.
- Then we have **< html >** tag which basically represents the elements in the entire web page.
- < html > tag has **< head >** and **< body >** tags within html, **head** represents the metadata( contents that's not visible for the user) and **body** represents all the the contents that are visible to the user.
- **< title >** tag represents the title for the document tab.
- **!+tab** shortcut can be used to generate a sample boilerplate in Visual Studio Code .

# < HTML >
  
  ## HTML Elements
  * **< p >** element **represents** a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as **blocks of text** separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.
  * The **< h1 > to < h6 >** HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. **We should never select different heading elements, just to adjust the size**. We should atmost have only one < h1 > in our file. We should not have an < h3 > without h2 and h1, simillarly for other header elements as well.
